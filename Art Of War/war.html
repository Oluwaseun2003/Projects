            <h2>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h2>
            <h1>
              The GREATEST <br />
              MILITARY STRAGIST
            </h1>

            <p>
              The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was
              <br />
              born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later <br />
              Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was
              <br />
              born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the
              <br />
              late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a <br />
              general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth
              <br />
              century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then
              <br />
              inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of
              <br />
              the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent <br />
              Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven <br />
              ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and <br />
              Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in
              <br />
              Eastern China.

            and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject

            warrior-philosopher now <br />
            famous all over the world as Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu s teachings remain as
            relevant <br />
            to leaders and strategists today as they were to rulers and military
            generals <br />
            in ancient times. Divided into thirteen chapters and written
            succinctly, The <br />
            Art of War is a must read for anybody who works in an competitive
            <br />
